Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in Barcelona working with Reason/OCaml and exploring the world of functional programming. I also co-host [emelle.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/emelletv), a talk show about these languages.

I work at [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/) where I build user interfaces, their design system, and tooling. As part of my job but also passion, I maintain a few open-source projects:

- [styled-ppx](https://github.com/davesnx/styled-ppx): Type-safe styled components for ReScript with type-safe CSS, including a CSS parser and type-checker.
- [server-reason-react](https://github.com/ml-in-barcelona/server-reason-react): Server rendering Reason React components in OCaml using Reason.
- [reason-react](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react): Reason bindings for React.js.
- [Reason](https://github.com/reasonml/reason): A programming language that combines the JavaScript and OCaml ecosystems. It is simple, fast, and type-safe.

I love running, cycling, skiing, coffee and minimalism.
You can find more about me on my personal site [sancho.dev](https://sancho.dev/).
