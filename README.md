Hi 👋, I'm David.

- Working remotely at [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com) as a Software engineer.
- These days I'm mostly doing OCaml 🐪 and ReasonML 🟥 (sometimes TypeScript 🛠️).
- Building [styled-ppx](https://github.com/davesnx/styled-ppx): styled components with typed CSS for ReScript.
- Co-host [EmelleTV](https://twitch.tv/emelletv), a streaming show talking about OCaml, Reason and ReScript.
- Previously worked at [Draftbit](https://draftbit.com) and [Typeform](https://typeform.com).
- Passionate in design, people, functional programming, scalability and startups, but lately compilers. Even with my limited English, I'm trying to write about those in my [blog](https://sancho.dev/blog).
