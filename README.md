### Hi 👋

I'm David Sancho.

I'm a Software Engineer based in Barcelona. Currently, creating cute software with ReasonML 🟥 and OCaml 🐪.

I co-host [EmelleTV](https://emelle.tv/) a talk show about these languages with @fakenickels.

Currently working at [Ahrefs](http://ahrefs.com/) remotely, working on UI stuff and building [styled-ppx](http://styled-ppx.vercel.app): "_Type safe styled components for ReScript_".

In my spare time, I train as an amateur triathlete focusing on Olympic and Half Ironman distances and write my thoughts on my [blog](https://sancho.dev/blog). You can read more about me in my [about page](https://sancho.dev/about).

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davesnx) where I tweet mostly about Reason, OCaml, ReScript, CSS, design systems and frontend technologies, but I might share some pictures of my cat.
