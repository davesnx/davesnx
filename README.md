Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in Barcelona working with Reason/OCaml and exploring the world of functional programming. I also co-host [emelle.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/emelletv), a talk show about these languages.

You can find more about me on my personal site [sancho.dev](https://sancho.dev/).
