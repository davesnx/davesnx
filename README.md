Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm David, a developer based on Barcelona.

Passionate in design, people, functional programming, scalability and startups, but lately about compilers. Even with my limited English, I'm trying to write about those in my [blog](https://sancho.dev/blog), and furthermore I co-host [EmelleTV](https://twitch.tv/emelletv) a streaming show talking about OCaml, Reason and ReScript.

Currently working remotely at [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com) as a Software engineer, building [styled-ppx](https://github.com/davesnx/styled-ppx) (styled components for ReScript, Reason and OCaml with typed CSS).

Previously worked at [Draftbit](https://draftbit.com) and [Typeform](https://typeform.com).
