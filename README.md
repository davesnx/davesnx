### Hi 👋!

I'm David Sancho.

I'm a Barcelona based Software Engineer, these days, trying to make cute software with Reason 🟥 and OCaml 🐪. I co-host [EmelleTV](https://emelle.tv/) a streaming show talking about these languages.

Currently working at [Ahrefs](http://ahrefs.com/) remotely, building [styled-ppx](http://styled-ppx.vercel.app): Typed styled components for ReScript.

In my spare time, I train as an amateur triathlete focusing on Olympic and Half Ironman distances, hack on a bunch of Open Source projects and write my thoughts on my [blog](https://sancho.dev/blog). You can read more about me in my [about page](https://sancho.dev/about).
